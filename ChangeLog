    Added the option of doing a final optimization using a simplex algorithm.
    The minimization algorithm is from the GNU Scientific Library (GSL)
    To use this option, add the keyword 'simplex' to the input file 
    followed by the maximum number of steps you wish it to take, ex: "simplex 10000"
